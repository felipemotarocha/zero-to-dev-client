# Zero To Dev (Client Side) üíª

> Simple learning platform built with React and Redux.

I built this application to help people who want to learn web development. It gives the user a roadmap of what he needs to learn and in which order.

# Quick Start üöÄ

Install the dependencies:

```bash
    yarn install
```

Create an `.env` file in the `root` directory with the following values:

```bash
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
    REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
```

_Of course you can change the **REACT_APP_API_URL** if your API URL is different or if you want to deploy the application to something like Heroku._

# How To Get Your Google Client ID

Read the official Google OAuth Documentation clicking [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid 'Google OAuth Documentation') to know how you can get yours. Don't forget to add the URL of the application (i.e http://localhost:3000) to the **Authorized JavaScript origins**.

# Running The Application

```bash
    yarn start
```

# Some Functionalities üìÅ

-   State management with Redux and Redux Saga
-   Authentication system with Google OAuth implemented
-   Note management system (the user can add notes to each video and improve his learning process)
-   Mobile responsiveness
