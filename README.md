# Zero To Dev (Client Side) üíª

> Simple learning platform built with React and Redux.

I built this application to help people who want to learn web development. It gives the user a roadmap of what he needs to learn and in which order.

# Quick Start üöÄ

Install the dependencies:

```bash
    yarn install
```

Create an `.env` file in the `root` directory with the following values:

```bash
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

_Of course you can change the value above if your API URL is different or if you want to deploy the application to something like Heroku, for example._

Now you can run the application with:

```bash
    yarn start
```
